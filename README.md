# eye_blink_detection
The goal of eye blink detection is to determine when a person blinks, which can be useful in various applications such as driver monitoring systems, human-computer interaction, and more. This is typically achieved by detecting the face and eyes in real-time video and monitoring the state of the eyelids.

Overview:

This project implements an eye blink detection system using OpenCV. The system captures video from a webcam, detects faces and eyes, and determines when a user blinks based on the eye aspect ratio (EAR). This technology can be utilized in various applications such as driver monitoring systems, attention tracking, and human-computer interaction.

Prerequisites:
  
  -Python 3.x
  
  -OpenCV
  
  -NumPy

Usage:

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.Navigate to the project directory:
  cd eye-blink-detection

3.Run the script:
  python eye_blink_detection.py

4.A window will open displaying the video feed from your webcam. The program will detect faces and eyes, and it will print "Blink detected!" in the console whenever a blink is recognized.

5.Press 'q' to quit the application.

Code Structure:

  eye_blink_detection.py: The main script for eye blink detection. It contains the logic for face and eye detection, as well as the blink detection using the eye aspect ratio.
  README.md: This file, which contains an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage details.
